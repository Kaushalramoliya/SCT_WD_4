## 📘 Project Overview  

This project was created as **Task 4** of my **Web Development Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective was to design and develop a **To-Do App** that not only manages daily tasks efficiently but also provides an **ultra-modern, elegant, and animated user interface**.

The app features **3D effects, hover animations, gradient buttons, and smooth transitions** for an engaging user experience.  
It is completely responsive and uses **LocalStorage** to store tasks permanently in the browser.
